We build and operate **secure, automated infrastructure** for partners who need dependable **stablecoin liquidity** on public blockchains.

**Core outcomes**

* **Deep & balanced liquidity** where you need it (CLOBs & CFMMs)
* **Efficient capital use** via vaultization and policy‑driven execution
* **Operational safety** with on‑chain controls and real‑time monitoring
* **Cross‑chain mobility** to move inventory quickly and verifiably

**Primary capabilities**

* Liquidity management & market operations **(BRZ/USDC, BRZ/USDT, IDRX/USDC, IDRX/USDT, BRZ/AUSD from Agora, and more)**
* Cross‑chain routing & settlement orchestration (EVM ↔ SVM)
* Policy‑guarded wallet automation (Gnosis Safe Guard + Module)
* Risk analytics, inventory targeting, and performance reporting
* White‑label integrations and partner APIs for programmatic control
